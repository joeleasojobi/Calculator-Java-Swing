This Window Calculator have been developed in Java Swing with a JFrame component. On the JFrame have been created a JPanel which holds all the buttons and TextField.

On the Jpanel have been created a number of buttons which will hold different functions and TextField for the user to input data. Every button will have a different function, which can either be a number (the one written on top of the button) or a mathematical operation.
